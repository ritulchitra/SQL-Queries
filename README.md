# 🛠️ SQL Practice Project

This project is a hands-on SQL learning journey where I practiced and implemented various SQL queries using a custom database.

## 📌 Project Overview

I started this project by asking ChatGPT to create a sample database for practicing SQL. The database was designed with multiple tables and realistic data to simulate real-world scenarios. I then used and updated the database to explore and strengthen my understanding of SQL concepts.

## ✅ What I Practiced

- `SELECT` statements for data retrieval  
- `WHERE` clauses for filtering results  
- `GROUP BY` to group data for aggregation  
- `HAVING` to filter grouped records  
- `ORDER BY` to sort the results  
- `VIEWS` for creating virtual tables  
- `SUBQUERIES` for nested query operations  

## 🧰 Tools Used

- SQL (MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQLite — specify which one you used)
- ChatGPT for generating the initial database
- Any SQL client (like DBeaver, MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin — if applicable
